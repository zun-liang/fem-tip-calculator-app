## Acknowledgments

A special thank you goes out to [@gurvirbaraich](https://github.com/gurvirbaraich) for his valuable contribution to this challenge! He spotted a critical bug related to the "numOfPeople" property, which could have allowed non-integer values. Although I chose to fix the bug myself for self-practice purposes, his keen observation and proposed solution would have greatly improved the challenge's quality. Please take a look at his wonderful [solution](https://github.com/zun-liang/tip-calculator-app-main/pull/1/commits/745ba783589379c45fa8486c9a66a3985f6320dd)!
